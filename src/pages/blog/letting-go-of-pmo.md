title: "Letting Go of PMO"
description: "My journey to be free of PMO has been a rocky one, but also one of the most important journeys I have undertaken. Today I feel I've finally arrived at a good understanding of what PMO is to me, and why it has been so addicting in the past."

Most of my understanding of this comes from reading the book the "The Easy Peasy Way To Quit Porn" an adaptation of Allen Carr's original book to quit smoking for Porn, Masturbation, and Orgasm (PMO), and around two and a half years of trial and error and relapse since reading the book.

Today I think I've finally understood PMO addiction for good. The conclusion I have come to is this:

It's simply a matter of belief. Yes or no. Do you believe that PMO, *or the lack of it* will bring you love, happiness, and meaning? 

Today when I had an urge, I told myself, *I'm not going to let porn rule over me*. 

I faced the urge head on and began masturbating. As recommended by Allen Carr for smokers, and out of belief of the scientific method, that a solid theory is testable. But because I believed orgasm would not grant me pleasure, meaning, love, and/or happiness, I no longer feared masturbating, or orgasm. While I recognized that my dick was stimulating me to some extent, the pleasure I felt was no longer gripping and overwhelming. I was not able to reach orgasm.

I've actually reached this state of understanding many times in the past. But I've always come to a relapse. I believe it is because over some arbitrary period of sobriety, I would become once again scared of PMO. Because whenever I did stop PMO for a while, I found that I was able to be more social and feel less tired, and often found academic successes and success in my personal hobbies. So I began to fear ever relapsing because I would start to believe that it was because I didn't PMO that the state of my life was on the mend. 

In reality, what I was doing was once again falling into the belief that PMO, **or the lack of it**, was the thing that was granting me pleasure, meaning, love, and/or happiness. 

When in reality, it is probably neither PMO nor the lack of PMO that would grant me love. That love has got to come from within, and/or from some other belief you hold. Whether that be love for yourself, love from some God, or the universe.

Human belief is a wonderful thing. When you believe in something, you grant it power over you. And then the thing you believe in can act on you in good ways, but also bad ways. If you believe that you love yourself, you may feel loved, but you may also find that you want to listen, protect, and understand yourself for who you are. If you believe in God, you may find a lot of meaning, but you may also be called to abide by the morals that said God sets forth. If you believe in PMO, you grant it the ability to give you tons of pleasure, and perhaps warmth and love, but at the cost of, well, having to perform the act to feel these things, and at the cost of in the lack of this act, loneliness, tiredness, and despair. And if you believe that not doing PMO would grant you a better life, then that works great when you're on a hot streak cold turkey, but you grant PMO the power to make you feel fear, fear at the thought of relapse, and you may perhaps find yourself, as I did, that at the point of relapse, to relapse over and over again, to not have to feel that fear of losing a long streak, to not have to feel that fear of being unloved or of meaninglessness.

The answer I thus arrive at is thus: believe neither in PMO, nor the lack of PMO. Find love, happiness, and meaning, waiting for you this instant, by loving yourself. And/or God. (I'm really not sure if God is a necessary source of love at this point in time. But there needs to be some source of love that is constant. That is unconditional. That you can have at this moment.) Don't let PMO rule over you. Don't believe that PMO, or the lack of it, will grant you love. Thus, *when* an urge arrives (and I find it always will at some point), you would therefore, necessarily not fear orgasm, or facing the urge head on by masturbating. And it is through that disbelief, which is scary at first, but not really once you face it and follow through with your beliefs, that PMO no longer stimulates.

You don't have to PMO to feel warm and loved. You don't have to wait 90 days to be loved. You aren't broken if you relapse. I firmly believe that you can be loved right now. But that takes letting go of PMO, and the courage, to really let it be let go.
